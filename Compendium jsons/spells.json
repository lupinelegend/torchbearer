It can be used to lift, carry and manipulate objects at a distance, as long as the caster can see the object they’re manipulating (a spell like Eye of the Overworld can be used to extend the caster’s sight). For example, it could be used to tie a rope to a tree limb high above, steal a key ring from a jailer’s belt while trapped in a cell or raise the lid of a sarcophagus. To mundane observers, it appears the objects are moving through the air on their own. Observers able to perceive the Otherworld can see the translucent, vaguely luminescent tentacles extending from the caster’s fngers.",
